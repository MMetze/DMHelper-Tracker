## General

**What is DM Helper?**

DM Helper (Or DMH for short) is a program for Windows 64 & MacOS that helps Dungeon Masters create, organize, and run sessions for their players. DMH is the ‘Swiss Army Knife of Dungeon Masters’


**What does it do?** 

DMH has a number varying tools to help any DM no matter their style:

•  Organize your NPCs, settings, adventures, and encounters with collapsible and expanding header  via the Campaign Tree.
•  Import Player Character data from D&D Beyond
•  Import battle maps to display to players on a secondary display, both images and video for those swanky animated maps
•  Display a Fog of War, that can be edited on the fly and displayed to your players over your battle map
•  Track combat information such as HP, AC, initiative, and player/NPC speed & position using DMH’s Initiative Tracker
•  Quickly access basic DM information such as conditions, actions, goods and services tables, a timer, and even a dice roller
•  Create custom tables to get random results on those nat 1s
•  All this and so much more!

## Troubleshooting

**I installed the program but it keeps crashing, saying something about a ‘MSVCP140.dll’?**

Unfortunately MSVCP140.dll is apart of Microsoft Visual Studio, and is required to run DM Helper. MSVCP140.dll is not pre-installed on any Windows versions before Windows 8, fortunately you can download MVS easily here http://bit.ly/DMH-MSVCP140


**How do I use my encounter that I made? **

Simply add monsters/NPCs to your encounter from the bestiary, or add them to the bestiary if necessary, and click the ‘Start Battle’ button. This should spawn another window titled ‘Battle View’ which displays all your monsters, NPCs, and player characters. The initiative for monsters and NPCs will automatically be rolled, while the player characters will have blank initiative values for you to enter via your players’ rolls.


**My map isn’t showing up in the ‘Battle View’, what gives?**

A battle map must be selected from the list of imported maps under the adventure in which your encounter takes place, by clicking the ‘Add Map’ button. 

NOTE: Maps in other adventures aren’t available to use. Example: Your encounter is in Adventure 1, however there is a map under Adventure 2 you want to add to the ‘Battle View’. This would not work. 

Alternatively you may add any map imported under the ‘World’ heading.


**I don’t see monster or player tokens in my battle encounter, what gives?**

More than likely your images are really small as they scale with the size of your grid scale. Try increasing your grid scale and see if you can find the images, if not please leave us a message in #bug-reports
